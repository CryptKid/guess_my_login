This Project will be moved
######

I was never a big fan of github as a proprietary Service, but as [Microsoft is now buying github](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/) Iâ€™m leaving it. You can find new versions of this project on [gitlab](gitlab.com/cryptkiddie) :

This repo is ment to last for about a month for legacy reason, please use the time to replace the github-Version with the gitlab-version

I apologize for your inconvenience.
